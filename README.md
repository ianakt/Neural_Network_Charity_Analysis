# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Purpose

  The purpose of this challenge was to  create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
  
 
 IS Succcessful is considered the target for our model, we decided to take out EIN, and Organization name from the model. We also binned to ignore values that occur infrequently.
 
 I wasn't able to reach 75% accuracy, I had tried adding more layers, and taking out ASK_amt however, none made the accuracy increase to 80%
